# Darner - https://github.com/wavii/darner
simple, lightweight message queue


## Description
Darner is a very simple message queue server. Unlike in-memory servers such as redis, Darner is designed to handle queues much larger than what can be held in RAM. And unlike enterprise queue servers such as RabbitMQ, Darner keeps all messages out of process, relying instead on the kernel's virtual memory manager via log-structured storage.
